# Chance-of-Admit
This project aims to predict the chance of admission of students into graduate programs based on various features such as GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, research experience, etc. Using Decision Tree Regression, we aim to build a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of admission.

- Decision Tree
  
A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It models decisions in a tree-like structure, where each internal node represents a test or decision on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of the decision, and each leaf node represents a final prediction or output.

**How It Works:**

`Root Node:` The tree starts with a root node, which represents the entire dataset. This node is split based on the feature that provides the highest information gain or the best split according to a chosen criterion (like Gini impurity or entropy for classification, and mean squared error for regression).

`Splitting:` The dataset is split into subsets based on the chosen feature. Each subset is further split recursively, forming a tree-like structure. The splitting continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth or having a minimum number of samples in a node.

`Leaf Nodes:` Once the tree can no longer be split, the leaf nodes provide the final prediction. In the case of regression, this is often the mean of the target values in that node.

`Decision Paths:` To make a prediction, the model starts at the root node and follows the decision paths according to the values of the input features until it reaches a leaf node.

**Example:**

Imagine you want to predict whether a student will be admitted to a graduate program. The Decision Tree might first split the data based on GRE scores. If a student's GRE score is above a certain threshold, the tree might then consider the student's CGPA. Depending on these features and others like research experience, the tree ultimately arrives at a decision, such as "Admitted" or "Not Admitted."

**Advantages:**

Easy to Understand: The tree-like structure is intuitive and can be easily visualized.
Non-linear Relationships: Decision Trees can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.

**Limitations:**

Overfitting: Trees can become overly complex and overfit the data, especially if not pruned or regularized.
Instability: Small changes in the data can result in a completely different tree structure.
